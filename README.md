# Machine Learning Diabetes Prediction - HackoonSpace 2020/2
## Conception
This is a Data Science and Machine Learning project that tries to predict early diabetes type two using simple algorithms - such as Decision Tree - just for learning purposes.
## Prerequisites and Resources
The implementation uses Python language with Jupyter Notebook and libraries as Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Sklearn. Also, the models are trained from the following data set:
