# Machine Learning Diabetes Prediction - HackoonSpace 2020/2
## Conception
This is a Data Science and Machine Learning project that tries to predict early diabetes type two using simple classification algorithms - such as Decision Tree. This project was done for study purposes and for an extension activity (HackoonSpace) of my university.

## Prerequisites and Resources
The implementation uses Python language with Jupyter Notebook and libraries as Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Sklearn. Also, the models are trained from the following data set:

1. "Early stage diabetes risk prediction dataset", downloadable at [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.)
